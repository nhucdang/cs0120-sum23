    <p>The reason why I wanted to take this class is build upon my foundation in website designing and understanding the overall lifecycle of implementing a website or web app. The future of applications are now moving towards cloud and web sites can now serve as web applications instead of being limited to local applications.</p>

    My favorite place to eat at all times. I am a big fan of spicy food and their Sichuan style. Some of my favorite dishes are sichuan cold noodles, ma la noodles (always get it extra spicy), chinese cabage with chili sauce and jin gu fish filet. Overall a recommendation, though not for the faint of heart on those who can consume spicy foods!

      Pho soups are usually a Vietnamese stable food with variation including chicken, beef, and seafood. Pho flavor comes mostly from its beef bones but for other variation such as seafood, it can use shrimp shell as a stock. The typical setup includes adding garnishes such as scallions,bean sprouts, a pinch of lime and eating with the Hoisin and Sriracha sauce.
